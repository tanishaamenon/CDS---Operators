# Experiment 3 and 4
**Aim:** <br>
To utilize various operators on C++.<br>
<br>
**Theory:** <br>
In C++, operators are special symbols that perform operations on operands. They are categorized into various types based on their functionality:<br>
<br>
_Arithmetic Operators:_ Used to perform mathematical operations.<br>
•	+  Addition <br>
•	-  Subtraction <br> 
•	 Multiplication <br>
•	/  Division <br>
•	%  Modulus <br>
•	++  Increment <br>
•	--  Decrement <br>
<br>
_Relational Operators:_ Used to compare two values.<br>
•	==  Equal to (this compares if the two are equal to each other and does not assign) <br>
•	!=  Not equal to <br>
•	>  Greater than <br>
•	<  Less than <br>
•	>=  Greater than or equal to <br>
•	<=  Less than or equal to <br>
<br>
_Logical Operators:_ Used to combine conditional statements.<br>
•	&&  Logical AND <br> 
•	||  Logical OR <br>
•	!  Logical NOT <br>
<br>
_Assignment Operators:_ Used to assign values to variables. <br>
•	=  Assignment <br>
•	+=  Add and assign <br>
•	-=  Subtract and assign <br>
•	*=  Multiply and assign <br>
•	/=  Divide and assign <br>
•	%=  Modulus and assign <br>
<br>
_Bitwise Operators:_ Operate on bits and perform bit-level operations. <br>
•	&  Bitwise AND <br>
•	|  Bitwise OR <br>
•	^  Bitwise XOR <br>
•	~  Bitwise NOT <br>
•	<<  Left shift <br>
•	>>  Right shift <br>
