# Experiment 3 and 4
**Aim:** <br>
To utilize various operators on C++.<br>
<br>
**Theory:** <br>
In C++, operators are special symbols that perform operations on operands. They are categorized into various types based on their functionality:<br>
<br>
_Arithmetic Operators:_ Used to perform mathematical operations.<br>
•	+ &#8594; Addition <br>
•	- &#8594; Subtraction <br> 
•	* &#8594; Multiplication <br>
•	/ &#8594; Division <br>
•	% &#8594; Modulus <br>
•	++ &#8594; Increment <br>
•	-- &#8594; Decrement <br>
<br>
_Relational Operators:_ Used to compare two values.<br>
•	== &#8594; Equal to (this compares if the two are equal to each other and does not assign) <br>
•	!= &#8594; Not equal to <br>
•	> &#8594; Greater than <br>
•	< &#8594; Less than <br>
•	>= &#8594; Greater than or equal to <br>
•	<= &#8594; Less than or equal to <br>
<br>
_Logical Operators:_ Used to combine conditional statements.<br>
•	&& &#8594; Logical AND <br> 
•	|| &#8594; Logical OR <br>
•	! &#8594; Logical NOT <br>
<br>
_Assignment Operators:_ Used to assign values to variables. <br>
•	= &#8594; Assignment <br>
•	+= &#8594; Add and assign <br>
•	-= &#8594; Subtract and assign <br>
•	*= &#8594; Multiply and assign <br>
•	/= &#8594; Divide and assign <br>
•	%= &#8594; Modulus and assign <br>
<br>
_Bitwise Operators:_ Operate on bits and perform bit-level operations. <br>
•	& &#8594; Bitwise AND <br>
•	| &#8594; Bitwise OR <br>
•	^ &#8594; Bitwise XOR <br>
•	~ &#8594; Bitwise NOT <br>
•	<< &#8594; Left shift <br>
•	>> &#8594; Right shift <br>
<br>
